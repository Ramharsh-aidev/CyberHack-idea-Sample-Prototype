# **Comprehensive Software Solution for Fake Narrative Detection**

## **Overview**

In today’s digital era, the spread of **fake news** and **deepfake videos** is a growing concern. Fake news misguides people and influences public opinion, while deepfakes use AI to create convincing yet entirely fake videos. This project offers a **software-only solution** that uses advanced **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to detect **fake narratives**—both in video and text formats.

This solution specifically aims to address two key challenges:

1. **Detecting Deepfakes**: Identifying manipulated video content by analyzing subtle **micro-expressions** and **biophysical anomalies** in the facial regions.
2. **Identifying Fake News**: Detecting sensationalism, factual inaccuracies, and bias in text-based content (e.g., news articles, social media posts).

### **Goal of the Project**

- **Detect deepfake videos** using **micro-expression** and **biophysical anomaly detection**.
- **Flag fake news** based on **content analysis** through **NLP** models.
- **Provide a fully software-based solution**, eliminating the need for specialized hardware such as thermal cameras or multi-spectral imaging.

## **Solution Overview**

The solution is divided into three main components:

1. **Micro-expression Analysis**: Detects subtle facial movements in videos to identify potential deepfakes.
2. **Biophysical Anomaly Detection**: Identifies inconsistencies in skin color and texture that are indicative of deepfake manipulation.
3. **Fake News Detection**: Uses NLP models to identify biased language, sensationalism, and factual discrepancies in news articles.

This approach uses **standard RGB video** and **text data** as input, leveraging deep learning, computer vision, and signal processing techniques to achieve robust results without the need for specialized hardware.

## **Key Features**

1. **Micro-expression & Biophysical Anomaly Detection in Videos**:
   - Detects subtle facial expressions and motion anomalies by analyzing **RGB video**.
   - Uses **motion magnification** to enhance small movements (e.g., micro-expressions) in video frames for easier detection.
   - Analyzes **skin color** and **texture** for anomalies, as deepfake algorithms often fail to replicate realistic human skin appearance.

2. **Fake News Detection in Text**:
   - Applies **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) to detect sensational language, sentiment bias, and factual inaccuracies in text.
   - Uses **BERT** and similar pre-trained models to understand the context and meaning of words within the news articles.
   - Identifies potential **fake news** by comparing it with known factual databases and analyzing its semantic meaning.

3. **Fully Software-Based Solution**:
   - No need for additional hardware like thermal or multi-spectral cameras.
   - The solution is highly scalable and can be deployed on standard computers or cloud services, making it easily accessible for large-scale implementation.

## **Technology Stack**

This solution relies on a combination of powerful **machine learning**, **computer vision**, and **NLP** techniques. Below are the technologies used:

### **Programming Languages**:
- **Python**: The primary language used for machine learning, computer vision, and NLP tasks.

### **Machine Learning Frameworks**:
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: Used for training and fine-tuning deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides classical machine learning tools for classification tasks (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines).

### **Computer Vision Libraries**:
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library used for image processing, face detection, and optical flow analysis in videos.
- **Mediapipe** and **dlib**: Used for facial landmark detection, facial expression analysis, and face tracking in RGB video.

### **Deep Learning Models**:
- **CNNs**: Used for feature extraction from facial images in videos.
- **RNNs/LSTMs** and **Transformers**: Applied to model temporal sequences of frames (for video) and words (for text), which is essential for detecting manipulated content.
- **Autoencoders**: Used for anomaly detection, where the model reconstructs images or frames and compares them with the original input.
- **GANs**: Generative adversarial networks can also be used in deepfake detection by comparing real vs. generated images.

### **Signal Processing**:
- **SciPy** and **NumPy**: Used for numerical analysis, filtering, and motion analysis.
- **Phase-Based Video Magnification**: Enhances subtle motions in video to detect small facial movements associated with micro-expressions.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
- **BERT**: A powerful pre-trained model for understanding the context and semantics of text, enabling better fake news detection.
- **spaCy**: NLP library for tokenization, entity recognition, and parsing text data.
- **TextBlob**: Used for basic sentiment analysis, polarity detection, and subjectivity in text.
- **ClaimBuster**: API used for automated fact-checking and claim validation in news articles.

## **Prototype Overview**

The prototype consists of two core modules: **video analysis** for deepfake detection and **text analysis** for fake news detection.

### **1. Micro-expression & Biophysical Anomaly Detection (Video)**

- **Input**: A video file (in RGB format).
- **Process**:
  - **Face Detection**: Detect faces in the video using **Mediapipe** or **dlib**.
  - **Micro-expression Detection**: Use **motion magnification** to amplify subtle facial movements, making it easier to detect micro-expressions indicative of deepfakes.
  - **Biophysical Anomaly Detection**: Analyze skin color variations and texture in the **RGB channels** to detect unnatural smoothness or inconsistencies.
- **Output**: A flagged video showing potential deepfake segments with highlighted facial anomalies.

### **2. Fake News Detection (Text)**

- **Input**: Text data (e.g., news articles, social media posts).
- **Process**:
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the input text using **spaCy** or **TextBlob**.
  - **NLP Model Analysis**: Use **BERT** to perform sentiment analysis, check for sensationalism, and compare factual accuracy.
  - **Fact-Checking**: Use **ClaimBuster** or similar tools to validate claims and identify fake news.
- **Output**: A report categorizing the article as **real** or **fake**, with detailed reasoning behind the classification (e.g., sensational language, factual discrepancies).

## **Installation Instructions**

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Open a terminal and clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramharsh-aidev/CyberHack-idea-Sample-Prototype.git
cd CyberHack-idea-Sample-Prototype
```

### **2. Set up Python Environment**

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. We recommend setting up a **virtual environment** for easy dependency management.

#### Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

#### Activate the Virtual Environment:
- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Now install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### **4. Run the Prototype**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the video processing and text analysis scripts.

To process a video and detect deepfakes based on micro-expressions and biophysical anomalies, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

To analyze text (e.g., news articles) for fake news detection, run the respective script for text analysis (e.g., `fake_news_detection.py`).
